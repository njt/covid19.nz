Summarising those:
- Spread by droplets from coughing and sneezing.
- Symptoms are like the flu (coughing, sneezing), and it can take 2-10 days between being exposed and having symptoms.
- If you have difficulty breathing, get medical help (worst case: call 111). That's a symptom of pneumonia.
- If you're sick, stay at home. Cover your sneezes with disposable tissues, wash your hands.

- There's no vaccine.
- There are no cases in NZ, so relax.
- There will probably eventually be some, because of people travelling into the country. But still relax, because there's nothing you can do about it.
- Directly flights between NZ and China are suspended temporarily, to reduce the risk of infected people arriving.
